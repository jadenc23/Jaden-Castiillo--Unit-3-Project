    <h1>This story begins in your residence at Mandela County. The News Broadcast has advised residents to stay home and
      to be armed. Reports of creatures who disguise as you and try to invade your home roam the town. It is around
      midnight, you've just put the 8-year-old that you were babysitting to sleep and go downstairs to relax in the
      living room. You see a figure standing outside
      your window. </h1>

    <h1>You back away from the window in utter fear as the figure stares you down. You realize it's one of those
      creatures that the broadcast was warning you about. The creature breaks through the window as it slowly creeps in
      your house. You spare no hesitation and run straigh to your garage to grab your firearm. You close the door behind
      you and grab your shotgun. The door opens and you fire out of pure instinct. You stare down at the body on the
      floor and your heart drops to your stomach. It wasn't the creature you just put to disease. It was the kid you
      were babysitting that came down to see what all the noise was. You drop down crying, the creature pops out staring
      while smiling menacingly. </h1>
    <p> YOU DID NOT SURVIVE THE NIGHT.</p>
